# Drowsy Driver Detection System

This project aims to detect driver drowsiness in real-time using computer vision techniques. By analyzing facial features, especially the eyes, the system determines if a driver is becoming drowsy and triggers alerts to prevent potential accidents.

- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilizes a webcam to monitor the driver's face continuously.
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**: Calculates EAR to determine eye closure over time.
- **Alert Mechanism**: Plays an alarm sound when drowsiness is detected.
- **Lightweight Model**: Employs a pre-trained YOLOv5 model for efficient face and eye detection.
